Second: in his review of church history, de Gruchy focused on the issue of church theology described in the 1985 Kairos South Africa document, in which churches use words that purport to support justice but actually serve to shore up the status quo of discrimination, inequality and racism. How does church theology manifest in the contemporary global context, and what is the remedy? The author proposes that ecumenism can serve as a mobilizing and organizing model for church action, and that active engagement in the issue of Palestine is an entry point for church renewal and for a necessary and fruitful exploration of critical issues in theology and ecclesiology.",

This made it possible to identify family time spent in building relationships as one of the key factors of its stability.

The data were obtained through the method of observing religious activities and conservation actions, interviewing the community leaders, and documenting the existence and activity of worshipers. The finding confirmed three aspects. First, the implementation of Sufism teachings is an alternative in nature conservation, not only aiming to meet the spiritual needs of pilgrims, but also fostering awareness of pilgrims to prevent damage to nature. Second, what is shown by pilgrims is very closely related to the human urge to always realize its basic capacity as a leader for nature. The forest is considered as a brother that the sustainability must be guarded, preserved, and guaranteed. Third, the teachings of Sufism become the basis for the group to act to be involved in caring for nature. This doctrine is inherited through formal media such as recitation and carried out in the form of direct action. Therefore, further studies are needed to explore the involvement of other religious organizations in the effort to conserve the environment in a sustainable manner",
